    "After investigating the features we noticed that some features were cummulative. After reading about the features on meteomatics we concluded that there were three different types of featuress.\n",
    "- Instantanious features, example: direct_rad. A feature of this kind would tell us the value at the exact time of date_forecast\n",
    "- Cummulative features, example direct_rad_energy_1h. These features included a timeinterval which told us in what period it was measured. for example a value at 15:00 for direct_rad_energy_1h:J told us that the total energy from the sun in the period 14:00-15:00\n",
    "- Lastly some features were neither stated as cummulative or instantanious, we assumed these to be cummulative of the last 15 minutes\n",
